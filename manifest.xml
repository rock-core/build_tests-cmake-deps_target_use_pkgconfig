  <description brief="Package that uses the pkg-config file generated by deps_target to check its validity">
    This package is part of a set of three that tests base/cmake DEPS_TARGET
    functionality. the deps_target package uses a CMake target exported by
    deps_target_dependency. This package (deps_target_use_pkgconfig)
    then tries to use the result as a pkg-config
    dependency.
