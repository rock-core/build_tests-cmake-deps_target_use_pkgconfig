Part of the Rock integration tests

Package that uses the pkg-config file generated by
[`deps_target`](https://github.com/rock-core/build_tests-cmake-deps_target) to check its
validity

This package is part of a set of three that tests
[base/cmake](https://github.com/rock-core/base-cmake) `DEPS_TARGET`
functionality. The `deps_target` package uses in turn CMake target exported by
`deps_target_dependency`. This package (`deps_target_use_pkgconfig`) then tries
to use the result as a pkg-config dependency.

If it builds, it works
